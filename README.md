# Static diagram
This diagram shows how decisions influence objective factors which in turn affect subjective values. Separate parts of the diagram are connected together by dashed arrows and dashed boxes. This diagram was used to build a decision support tool. This tool allows you to input your assumptions about Brexit and the extent to which you value different factors. Based on that it calculates total expected values of the different Brexit options and makes a recommendation.
